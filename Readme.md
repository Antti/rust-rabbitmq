rust-rabbitmq
=============

rust-rabbitmq is a rust binding to [librabbitmq-c]

I'm very new to rust, and this is my "hello world" lib.
It may contain bugs and be written not in a good rust style.

**You'll need to have librabbitmq-c in order to use this**


Build:
------

```sh
git clone [git-repo-url] rust-rabbitmq
cd rust-rabbitmq
rake build
```

Usage:
------

See hello.rs example
